# Crypto Trading Simulator
This project is not complete yet, this is part of my *[How to  Build a Simple Crypto Trading Simulator]* Series. The idea is to help beginneer investor learn and experiment without losing real money.

Sandra created a Cryptocurrency Trading System Simulator WebApp on buying and selling crypto, with the abilities of tracking performance history and profit/loss.

Sandra创建了一个用于买卖加密货币的加密货币交易系统模拟器(WebApp)，本模拟器具有跟踪性能历史记录和计算损益的能力。
